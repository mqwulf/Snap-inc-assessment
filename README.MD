## Summary

 This web application is a characters catalog featuring a dynamic user interface for browsing and searching through a list of characters from the Dragon Ball series. Users can search for characters by name, sort them based on health or attack points, and filter them by categories such as gender and race. Each character is displayed with their name, race, gender, health points, attack points, biography, abilities, and a photo.
